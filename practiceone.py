# user defined functions are those functions which  we write in the python


#wap to print the length of a list (list is the parameter)
# in simple way
cities =["delhi","mumbai","kashmir","ladakh","shimla","ffff"]
print(len(cities))


# in function way



# def function(cities):
    

#     cities =["delhi","mumbai","kashmir","ladakh","shimla"]
#     print(len(cities))
#     return cities
    

# two list at that time we call the parameter list




places = ["urdu","english", "hindi","kashmiri"]
def first(places):
    
    print(len(places))
