# traversing a list, string, tuple

#for element in list:

# for loop using string list

# for loop using tuple in list


# abc =(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,)

# for good in abc:
#     print(good)
    

# for loop with else
# for element in list:

#work with loop ends

for good in abc:
    print(good)
    

# the work which we want to till end that is why we use else statement
